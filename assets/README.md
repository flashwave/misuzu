# Misuzu Assets

Subdirectories of the `css` and `js` folder are accessible through the web as `example.com/assets/<subdirectory>.<directory>`.
Meaning `/assets/js/misuzu` is accessible as `/assets/misuzu.js`.
Files are concatenated recursively, files first then directories in alphabetical order.
Use `_` prefixes to raise things up.
